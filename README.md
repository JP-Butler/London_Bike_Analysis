# London Bike Analysis

## Description
This Dashboard creation was a guided BI project using Tableau, created by [Mo Chen](https://www.youtube.com/@mo-chen). Utilizing various Tableau features, I recreated an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize [London Bike Sharing data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset). Sourced from **Kaggle**, the data represents information on a bike sharing program ran in London, from January 2015 to January 2017. Multiple charts were created and formatted, then organized together in dashboard format with multiple filter tools to sort and refine the data based on the user's input. Such as a search bar for moving average duration, a drop down menu for moving average period selection and a timeline slider for time frame selection.

## Overview & Aim
To provide a user-friendly dynamic visualization for stakeholders to use that will allow for easy data driven decision making.
